# Java-MVC
In this program we are going to demonstrate Java Swing MVC.
The MVC pattern is a model of how a user interface can be structured. 

Therefore it defines the following 3 elements:
  1. Model that represents the data for the application.
  2. View that is the visual representation of that data.
  3. Controller that takes user input on the view and translates that to changes in the model.
